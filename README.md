# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
I have been working on trainign and evaluating models with unbalanced classes for different credit card risk approval models. We analyzed undersampling and oversampling the data as well as a combination approach that both oversamples and undersamples the data. We then compared two models that reduce bias, the BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. I will then provide a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk

## Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
